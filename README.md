# Mobile Development

We aim to develop a modern and visually attractive application. In developing this application we use Kotlin programming and utilize various libraries such as Room, Retrofit2, Material Design, CircleIndicator, Carousel Recyclerview, MPAndroidChart, and others. We also implement clean code architecture, connect apps to APIs, and use machine learning in our apps. We used Figma to design the interface of the EmoQu app. This application is designed with appropriate features based on the existing problems and user needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack & Open-source libraries
<!-- Test -->
- Minimum SDK level 24
- Architecture
MVVM Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model)
Repository Pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/android?hl=id): TensorFlow Lite is an open source deep learning framework for on-device inference.
- [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) : Material Design is to provide consistent and intuitive design guidelines for application development.
- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines?hl=id) : Coroutine is a concurrent design pattern that you can use in Android to simplify asynchronously executed code.
- [Carousel Recyclerview](https://github.com/sparrow007/CarouselRecyclerview) : A custom RecyclerView for creating a carousel of views with various transformations.
- [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) : A powerful & easy to use chart library for Android, supporting line, bar, pie, radar, and other chart types.
- [CircleIndicator](https://github.com/ongakuer/CircleIndicator) : A lightweight indicator like in a ViewPager.


## üí° Design with Figma
<!-- Test -->
- [Mobile Design](https://www.figma.com/file/5gnRl5pdbAD3HzFzi132ps/TemanSawit-%7C-Bangkit-Capstone?type=design&node-id=2%3A430&t=WKjh8UlYX8DIFvlz-1)

## üí° Features
<!-- Test -->
EmoQu has three main features:
- Track Activities, Moods, & Notes
EmoQu allows users to log their daily activities, moods, and personal notes. Users can record what they did throughout the day, how they felt during those activities, and any additional notes or thoughts they want to capture. 

- Classify Tracking Results into Conditions
EmoQu analyzes the tracked data to classify it into various mental and emotional conditions. Using machine learning algorithms, the app identifies patterns and correlations between activities and mood changes, categorizing the results into specific conditions.

- Generate Daily Report
EmoQu compiles the tracked data and classifications into a comprehensive daily report. The report includes summaries of activities, mood trends, identified conditions, and personalized insights or recommendations.
